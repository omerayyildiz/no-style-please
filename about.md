Hi, I'm Ömer!
I have been interested in software and design for about 4 years. Currently, I'm studying graphic design in Turkey. I constantly read articles and do side projects to keep my work clean and qualified. I get along well with people. That's why I work as a management consultant for many communities. I always try to achieve success by handling projects, design, communities, and software from all aspects. I love illustration, typography, minimalism and pixel art.
